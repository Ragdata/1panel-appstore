## [Features](#top) ✨

- **Resource Discovery:** Discover network entities, server resources, and onboard/offboard devices.  Use out-of-the-box integrations (templates) to monitor anything froma low-level device to a full SaaSService.
- **Metric Acquisition:** Use an agent or agent-less approach for metric acquisition from any source - devices, sensors, operating systems, visualization platforms, container platforms (like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.), cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), cloud infrastructure, databases, websites, application servers, API endpoints, business applications, and more.
- **Root Cause Analysis & Problem Detection:** High-performance, real-time problem detection that correlates both existing and incoming problems and performs root cause analyses.
- **Incidents, Alerts, and Notifications:** Receive an alert when an issue is triggered (proactively or post-mortem) in the ecosystem.  Use multiple messaging channels (including Slack, JIRA, Micosoft Teams, email or SMS) to get notified about the different types of events on your network.
- **"Single Pane of Glass" Overview:** Visualize collected data and monitoring events in graphs, geomaps, and network topology maps.
- **Multitenancy and Distributed Monitoring:** Enjoy the convenience of one monitoring solution for multiple data centers, departments, and organizations.  Monitor remote locations behind firewalls with remote command execution capability
- **Unparalleled Flexibility:** Adapt Zabbix to your needs and utilize built-in functionalities, including the ability to stream metrics and events over HTTP, reporting, auditing, security, service SLA calculations, and many more.
